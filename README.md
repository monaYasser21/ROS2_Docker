 I pulled an ubuntu:24.04 Image as Ros_2 only works on this version or higher, you can download these files and put them into a directory in addition to a copy 
 from your .bashrc file , Don't forget to source it using source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
 PS: I have run it as a root, you can run it either as a root or adding a username like ros_jazzy
